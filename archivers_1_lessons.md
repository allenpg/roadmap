# Archivers 1.0 Lessons

## ANCA Data Rescue Feedback:
The Act Now Chicago Area Data rescue organizers have put together an invaluable postmortem from their event. It's worth reviewing in full:

From a high level (while staying in the app/technical realm), there seems to be a few key takeaways:

*Too many permissions settings, or they aren't clear enough:*
> * Unclear process for Checker/Bagger and Describer logins and permissions
> * Restrictive permissions prevents clear confirmation process was done right
> * Read the event issues spreadsheet for more details
> * Doesn’t show users an admin as invited for a specific event

*Need clearer feedback mechanisms for contributions:*
> * In-progress archive does not show uploads done by previous Harvesters
> * App doesn’t track individual or group contributions or create reports

*Onboarding needs work*
> * Volunteers took a lot of time getting set up
> * Volunteers would like a tutorial on how to use the Archivers app

*Workflow needs to simplify*
The ANCA deck then goes into detail on how to streamline the workflow. It's worth reviewing these slides in full.
We should work to integreate this feedback directly into later versions of the app, automatically tracking any & everything
we can, and providing direct links to resources to up the chances that a user will be able to find the info they need.

## Dataset Registries & Collaboration
This issue outlines a key concern with our current workflow, namely how we will interface & collaborate with others:
