# Proposed Services Overview

This repo is to get people acquainted with a new set of proposed services. Everything here is subject to rapid change while we build tech & gather community feedback. If you're looking for a more stable place to contribute code, it's probably better to start with the [edgi overview repo](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview), and then come back here!

To understand where this proposal evolved from, here's a [timeline of services](services_story.md) explains how we've gotten to this point.
