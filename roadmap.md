# Rollout plan
New services will be rolled out as a "beta", parallel to the service they're intended to replace. 
The switch from old to new service will only happen once the new service is deemed ready & a gap appears in the
event schedule that gives enough time to make the switch. It will be the responsibility of the community
to test beta products for both Quality & usability. Changes to services should be made with enough advance
notice that no event organizer is taken by suprise.
